##Typescript based API framework built on top of express

I took inspiration from angular for directory structure and module splitting. The framework is compatible with openapi standards and follows SOLID principles. It can generate frontend classes which integrates with redux saga via a library which I created https://github.com/aruntk/redux-api-saga. Developers are finding it highly helpful as it gives them proper structure and ability to test. Along with that they dont have to write a lot of boilerplate code

##NextJS like front-end framework with SSR support

##Summarization framework built on top of flask
